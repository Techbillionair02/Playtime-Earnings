# Playtime-Earnings
Automatically pays players for every minute they remain online. This plugin integrates with the Economics plugin and awards players $20 per hour of active playtime (paid out every 60 seconds). Payments accumulate safely using a buffer system to avoid decimal rounding issues and are deposited directly into the player’s Economics balance.
